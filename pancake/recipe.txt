Pancakes:
In a bowl, whisk the egg and milk together until well combined.
In a separate bowl, mix the flour, sugar, and cocoa powder.
Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring until smooth and no lumps remain.
Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat and lightly grease it.
Pour a small amount of batter into the pan and cook until bubbles form on the surface, then flip and cook the other side until done.
Serve with your favorite toppings, like whipped cream or fresh fruit.
the end!
eat while warm!
